# chess_engine
An ongoing project where I am applying deep reinforcement learning to build my own chess AI.

## About

I'm a huge fan of chess and have been thinking about writing my own chess engine for a while. Following some work on deep reinforcement learning, I decided to have a go.

For personal interest, I decided to code the rules from scratch (i.e. not using an available Python chess package).
